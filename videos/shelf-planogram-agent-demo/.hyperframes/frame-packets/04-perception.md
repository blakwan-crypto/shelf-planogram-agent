## Frame 4 — Perception: ScannerAgent

- scene: An invented shelf image receives product-location boxes; ScannerAgent sends a ShelfScan envelope to the next station.
- voiceover: "First, preprocessing rejects bad inputs. Then ScannerAgent uses a SKU-110K-trained YOLO model to find product locations — not brand names."
- duration: 12.309s
- poster: 8s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/04-perception.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Demonstration and scope boundary
- beat: Comprehension
- blueprint: agent-progress-theater (Adapt)
- focal: ScannerAgent’s working state and ShelfScan receipt
- roles: validation status = foreground subject · invented shelf image and detection boxes = midground · warm cream grid = background

Adapt: keep the working-state theater and receipt cascade; replace a generic checklist with a validation status, product-location boxes, and a typed ShelfScan envelope.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.5s): a validation panel appears in the upper-left with “valid image 1280×960”; a thin coral scan arc draws on (`svg-path-draw`) while the shelf schematic remains dim.
Scene 2 (2.5–5.7s): as the narration names product locations, detection boxes appear in two staggered rows across the shelf schematic (`spring-pop-entrance`); the status changes from “scanning” to “found products” (`discrete-text-sequence`).
Scene 3 (5.7–9.0s): the ScannerAgent label docks to the top-left and a warm-navy ShelfScan envelope expands beside it (`anchored-layout-expand`); the model boundary “locations, not brands” highlights once (`css-marker-patterns`).
Scene 4 (9.0–12.3s): the receipt card holds with boxes and message metadata still; the working spinner stops exactly as the envelope lands.

narrativeRole: Demonstrate perception while making the model's honest scope explicit.
keyMessage: The detector supplies visual evidence about where products are, while validation provides graceful failure before inference.

## Selected motion rule: anchored-layout-expand

---
name: anchored-layout-expand
description: Edge-pinned container grows (or collapses) along ONE axis and in-flow content reflows with it — a pill springs open downward into a dropdown, a panel grows a sub-task stack, an input card stretches as typed text wraps, a pane expands over a neighbor. Transform-only (mask + slide, or proxy-driven scaleY + counter-scale) because width/height tweens are forbidden; the push on subsequent content is a matched translate on the same tween.

# Anchored Layout Expand

> The law: **author the layout at its final (expanded) state in CSS, then fake the collapsed state with transforms.** The container never changes size — the _visible_ region does — and everything downstream rides a matched translate. The browser computes layout ONCE; every intermediate frame is pure transform.

THE one-axis growth primitive: a container pinned at one edge appears to grow along a single axis, and the in-flow content after it moves in perfect contact with the traveling edge — dropdown, sub-task stack, growing composer card, pane widening over a neighbor. Growth and push are ONE motion: if the panel's bottom edge and the pushed content ever separate or overlap, the illusion dies.

Distinct from [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (a free-floating two-shot morph with no neighbors to push — this rule's container is a live layout participant), [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md) (arrival at a point, no edge travel or reflow), and [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md) (displacement by a colliding intruder; here content moves because the container's edge reached it — layout causality, not collision).

## How It Works

1. **Mask** — a wrapper at the final body height (`BODY_H`), `overflow: hidden`. Never tweened.
2. **Sheet** — the panel surface + content inside the mask, starting at `y: -BODY_H` (tucked above the mask window, behind the pinned header).
3. **Below** — ONE wrapper holding everything after the container, also starting at `y: -BODY_H`.
4. **Grow** — ONE `fromTo` drives sheet AND below from `y: -BODY_H → 0`. Shared tween ⇒ the descending bottom edge and the pushed content stay in exact contact by construction. Collapse = the same pair tweened back.

When the surface must visibly **stretch in place** (rows revealed top-first, or a pane growing sideways), use the proxy counter-scale variant below instead.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="stack">
  <div class="expander">
    <div class="expander-head">{headerLabel}</div>
    <div class="expand-mask" id="expand-mask" data-layout-allow-overflow>
      <div class="expand-sheet" id="expand-sheet">
        <div class="expand-row">{rowA}</div>
        <div class="expand-row">{rowB}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- EVERYTHING that must be pushed lives in this one wrapper -->
  <div class="below" id="below">{followingContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Layout is the EXPANDED end state — no collapsed geometry exists in CSS. */
.expander-head {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* the sheet slides out from UNDER the header */
}
.expand-mask {
  height: BODY_H; /* authored final height — NEVER tweened */
  overflow: hidden;
}
.expand-sheet {
  height: BODY_H;
  border-radius: 0 0 SHEET_RADIUS SHEET_RADIUS; /* bottom-only — header + sheet read as one grown card */
  will-change: transform; /* + on .below */
}
```

```js
// BODY_H must equal the mask's CSS height exactly — measure once at build.
// (Montage caveat: per the contract, in a multi-scene master use an authored
// CSS-matched constant instead — later clips may not be laid out yet.)
const BODY_H = document.querySelector("#expand-mask").offsetHeight;

// The grow: ONE tween, BOTH sides of the seam.
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: -BODY_H },
  { y: 0, duration: GROW_DUR, ease: GROW_EASE },
  GROW_AT,
);

// Garnish: rows already ride the sheet; the fade stagger makes them read as "options arriving".
tl.fromTo(
  ".expand-row",
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, duration: ROW_FADE_DUR, stagger: ROW_STAGGER, ease: "power2.out" },
  GROW_AT + GROW_DUR * 0.25,
);

// Collapse — same machinery back; faster (closing is a snap decision).
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: 0 },
  { y: -BODY_H, duration: COLLAPSE_DUR, ease: "power3.in", immediateRender: false },
  COLLAPSE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Proxy counter-scale — surface stretches in place** (rows revealed top-first holding their screen positions; the "payload card expands from the tool-call line"). Drive mask `scaleY` and the sheet's exact inverse from ONE proxy — two independent tweens are wrong: eased midpoints of `s` and `1/s` are not inverses and the content squashes mid-grow. Net content scale is `s × 1/s = 1` every frame; seek-safe because everything derives from the one interpolated proxy.

  ```js
  const grow = { h: COLLAPSED_H }; // 0 for fully collapsed
  tl.fromTo(
    grow,
    { h: COLLAPSED_H },
    {
      h: BODY_H,
      duration: GROW_DUR,
      ease: GROW_EASE,
      onUpdate: () => {
        const s = Math.max(grow.h / BODY_H, 0.0001); // clamp: no divide-by-zero
        gsap.set("#expand-mask", { scaleY: s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#expand-sheet", { scaleY: 1 / s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#below", { y: grow.h - BODY_H });
      },
    },
    GROW_AT,
  );
  ```

- **One-axis pane expand (X)**: same machinery rotated 90° — pin the left edge, sheet from `x: -PANE_W` (or proxy `scaleX` + counter-scale, origin `0% 50%`). Decide the neighbor's fate explicitly: **overlap** (pane paints over it, no neighbor tween) or **push** (neighbor rides the same tween). Never both.
- **Typed-wrap growth** — the composer card gets taller as typed text wraps. Quantize: one short step per wrap boundary, each moving the pair by one `LINE_H`; wrap times come from the deterministic typing schedule ([discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)), never measured at render time. Two battle-tested traps:
  - **Composer cards have no pinned header** — a composer grows from its TOP edge (the send-button footer stays put), so a plain y-step clips the card's top out of the mask. Combine the proxy counter-scale with the wrap quantization (step the proxy by `LINE_H` at each wrap time) and split the surface into a **sheet** (carries the top radius) + **footer** (carries the bottom radius) so the growth seam stays invisible.
  - **Wrap TIME vs wrap POSITION are two different authorities** — the typing schedule decides _when_ a wrap fires, the browser's line-breaking decides _where_ text actually wraps, and with proportional fonts they silently disagree. Author an explicit `\n` in the typed string (with `white-space: pre-wrap`) at the chosen split point so both derive from the same authored fact.
- **Springy open** (rare, explicitly-playful): `back.out(1.2)` — the edge overshoots a few px; the pushed content bounces with the panel (correct — they're in contact). Default stays `power3.out`.
- **Row grows a sub-task stack**: the row is the pinned header, the stack is the sheet, every later row lives in `#below`; chain several scopes for progressive disclosure.
- **FLIP hand-off**: if the container also TRAVELS to a new layout slot while resizing (prompt promoted to heading, card docking into a sidebar), that's a FLIP problem — `/hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP recipes). This rule stays the in-place one-axis specialist.

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` / `margin` / `padding`** — the mask's height is a CSS constant; only its children transform. Tweening the mask IS the forbidden move this rule replaces.
- **`data-layout-allow-overflow` on the mask** — the collapsed phase parks the sheet outside the mask's box by construction, which trips the `hyperframes check` layout gate (`container_overflow`). The flag is the sanctioned waiver: this overflow is the technique working as designed, not a bug.
- **Sheet + below share one tween (or one proxy)** — matched-but-separate tweens on the two sides of the contact edge are the classic seam bug.
- **Everything downstream rides `#below`** — content outside the wrapper is overlapped at t=0 and orphaned during the grow.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the mask** — without it the tucked sheet is visible above the header at t=0.
- **Counter-scale needs a proxy**, clamped `s ≥ 0.0001` (a fully-collapsed body divides by zero).
- **Deterministic sizes** — `BODY_H`, `LINE_H`, `WRAP_TIMES` are build-time constants or one-time measurements, never per-frame layout reads.

## Selected motion rule: css-marker-patterns

# CSS Patterns for Marker Highlighting

Pure CSS + GSAP implementations of all five MarkerHighlight.js drawing modes — no external library dependency, full timeline control. Snippets show mechanism DOM only, inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core); assume `tl` exists.

Shared scaffold for every mode: the wrap is `position: relative; display: inline`; the text copy is `position: relative` and z-indexed **above** the accent (below it for sketchout, where the lines cross the text).

## 1. Highlight Mode

Yellow marker sweep behind text — the most common mode.

```html
<span class="mh-highlight-wrap">
  <span class="mh-highlight-bar" id="hl-1"></span>
  <span class="mh-highlight-text">highlighted text</span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-highlight-bar {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -6px; /* bleed past the text edges */
  background: #fdd835;
  opacity: 0.35;
  transform: scaleX(0);
  transform-origin: left center;
  border-radius: 3px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#hl-1", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.5, ease: "power2.out" }, 0.6);
// Optional hand-drawn skew: gsap.set("#hl-1", { skewX: -2 });
// Multi-line: tl.to(".mh-highlight-bar", { scaleX: 1, ..., stagger: 0.3 }, 0.6);
```

## 2. Circle Mode

Hand-drawn ellipse around text — `border-radius: 50%` plus a slight rotation for organic feel.

```html
<span class="mh-circle-wrap">
  <span class="mh-circle-text">IMPORTANT</span>
  <span class="mh-circle-ring" id="circle-1"></span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-circle-ring {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 130%; /* tight (short words): 150%; rounded-rect: 120% + border-radius: 30% */
  height: 160%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) rotate(-3deg) scale(0);
  border: 3px solid #e53935;
  border-radius: 50%;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.to("#circle-1", { scale: 1, rotation: -3, duration: 0.6, ease: "back.out(1.7)" }, 0.7);
```

## 3. Burst Mode

Radiating lines from text center — each line a positioned span rotated to its angle. Use ~12 lines at 30° steps and **vary `--len` (40–80px)**; equal lengths look mechanical.

```html
<span class="mh-burst-wrap">
  <span class="mh-burst-text">WOW</span>
  <span class="mh-burst-container" id="burst-1">
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 0deg; --len: 70px;"></span>
    <span class="mh-burst-line" style="--angle: 30deg; --len: 55px;"></span>
    <!-- …one line per 30° step through 330deg, --len varied 40-80px -->
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-burst-container {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  width: 0;
  height: 0;
  z-index: 1; /* text copy at z-index: 2 */
}
.mh-burst-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  width: 3px;
  height: var(--len);
  background: #1e88e5;
  left: -1.5px;
  top: calc(-1 * var(--len));
  transform: rotate(var(--angle));
  transform-origin: bottom center;
  opacity: 0;
}
```

```js
tl.fromTo(
  "#burst-1 .mh-burst-line",
  { scaleY: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scaleY: 1, opacity: 1, duration: 0.4, ease: "power2.out", stagger: 0.03 },
  0.7,
);
```

## 4. Scribble Mode

Wavy SVG underline that draws itself via `stroke-dashoffset`.

```html
<span class="mh-scribble-wrap">
  <span class="mh-scribble-text">underlined text</span>
  <svg class="mh-scribble-svg" viewBox="0 0 500 24" preserveAspectRatio="none">
    <path
      id="scribble-1"
      d="M0,12 Q31,0 62,12 Q93,24 125,12 Q156,0 187,12 Q218,24 250,12 Q281,0 312,12 Q343,24 375,12 Q406,0 437,12 Q468,24 500,12"
      fill="none"
      stroke="#FDD835"
      stroke-width="3"
      stroke-linecap="round"
    />
  </svg>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-scribble-svg {
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  bottom: -6px; /* strikethrough variant: top: 50%; transform: translateY(-50%) */
  width: 100%;
  height: 24px;
  z-index: 0;
}
```

```js
const path = document.querySelector("#scribble-1");
const len = path.getTotalLength();
gsap.set(path, { strokeDasharray: len, strokeDashoffset: len });
tl.to("#scribble-1", { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: 0.8, ease: "power1.inOut" }, 0.7);
```

Path tuning: the `Q` control points alternate y between 0 and 24 for a natural wobble. Tighter waves = smaller x-increments (~25px per half-wave); looser = ~50px; subtler amplitude = y range 0–16.

## 5. Sketchout Mode

Cross-hatch over de-emphasized text — two angled lines create a "crossed out" effect.

```html
<span class="mh-sketchout-wrap">
  <span class="mh-sketchout-text">old price</span>
  <span class="mh-sketchout-lines" id="sketchout-1">
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-fwd"></span>
    <span class="mh-sketchout-line mh-sketchout-bwd"></span>
  </span>
</span>
```

```css
.mh-sketchout-lines {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0 -4px;
  overflow: hidden;
  z-index: 1; /* text at z-index: 0 — the lines cross OVER it */
}
.mh-sketchout-line {
  position: absolute;
  display: block;
  top: 50%;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 2px;
  background: #e53935;
  transform-origin: left center;
}
.mh-sketchout-fwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(-12deg);
}
.mh-sketchout-bwd {
  transform: scaleX(0) rotate(12deg);
}
```

```js
// Forward slash first, backward follows
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-fwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.0);
tl.to("#sketchout-1 .mh-sketchout-bwd", { scaleX: 1, duration: 0.3, ease: "power2.out" }, 1.15);
```

## Combining Modes in Captions

Cycle modes across caption groups for visual variety — every 2-3 groups for high energy, 3-4 for medium, 4-5 for low:

```js
const MODES = ["highlight", "circle", "burst", "scribble"];
GROUPS.forEach((group, gi) => {
  const mode = MODES[gi % MODES.length];
  group.emphasisWords.forEach((word) => applyMode(word.el, mode, tl, word.start));
});
```

## Selected motion rule: discrete-text-sequence

---
name: discrete-text-sequence
description: Replace entire text states at frame thresholds for non-linear typing effects — typos, bulk additions, pauses, backspaces, simulated thinking.
metadata:
  tags: text, typing, discrete, threshold, non-linear, sequence
---

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Spring-Pop Entrance

> **Smooth beats bouncy.** This entrance defaults to a smooth long-tail settle — `power3.out` (or `expo.out` for a faster front) — that decelerates cleanly into the resting size with **no overshoot**. Bouncy `back.out` is the **#1 instant turn-off** in agent-made videos and is almost never executed well; it is a rare, explicitly-playful exception (consumer / fun brand), never the default. When unsure, settle smoothly.

THE entrance primitive: an element (or staggered group) arrives by springing from nothing — `scale: 0 → 1`, optional small `y` rise — and settles without bouncing. This is **arrival**, not reaction: distinct from [press-release-spring.md](press-release-spring.md) (a click/press → release feedback chain on an element that already rests on screen). Many blueprints used to borrow that rule to fake an entrance; reach for this instead.

## How It Works

One `fromTo` carries the whole arrival: from `{ scale: 0, opacity: 0 }` (explicit, so t=0 is correct under seek) to `{ scale: 1, opacity: 1, ease: "power3.out" }`. For a **group**, the same `fromTo` runs per element at `i * STAGGER`, capped so the group reads as one arriving beat. The `scale` grow is load-bearing; the `y` rise is garnish — drop everything else and it must still read as a clean entrance. Let the ease produce the settle: never hand-key a `scale: 1.1` mid-state (it double-bounces against the curve).

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="pop-hero" id="hero">{heroLabel}</div>

<div class="pop-grid">
  <div class="pop-item">{itemA}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemB}</div>
  <div class="pop-item">{itemC}</div>
</div>
```

```css
.pop-hero,
.pop-item {
  transform-origin: 50% 50%; /* in-place pop; move to the source point for the anchored variation */
  will-change: transform;
}
.pop-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: GRID_GAP;
  place-items: center;
}
```

```js
// Single hero pop — smooth long-tail settle, no overshoot.
tl.fromTo(
  "#hero",
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0 },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  ENTRY_AT,
);

// Staggered group pop — one arriving beat.
gsap.utils.toArray(".pop-item").forEach((el, i) => {
  tl.fromTo(
    el,
    { scale: 0, opacity: 0, y: Y_RISE },
    { scale: 1, opacity: 1, y: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
    GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Calm settle** (premium / enterprise): `power3.out`, no rotation, `Y_RISE` 0–12px — a weighted, confident landing for a hero wordmark or product shot.
- **Firm settle** (everyday default): `power3.out` or `expo.out` for a punchier front, `Y_RISE` ~24px — cards, icons, callouts.
- **Exact-physics settle**: when the settle IS the shot, swap the ease for `springEase({ response: 0.4 })` (critically damped) from `../adapters/gsap-easing-and-stagger.md` → Spring Eases; take `duration` from the helper.
- **Origin-anchored pop**: a callout growing out of a specific point (marker, pointer tip) sets `transform-origin` to that point (e.g. `0% 100%`) so `scale: 0 → 1` reads as "emerging from the source", not "inflating in place".
- **Pop into a held slot**: land the pop and hold still — no idle loop baked into the entrance. If the held frame genuinely needs life, hand off to [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for subtle jitter on a separate later tween; prefer revealing the next element on its VO cue.
- **Bouncy pop (RARE — explicitly-playful only)**: swap the ease for `back.out(OVERSHOOT)` and optionally settle a small `rotation: ROT_FROM → 0` so elements look hand-placed. Only for a deliberately playful register — never product / enterprise / serious tone:

```js
tl.fromTo(
  el,
  { scale: 0, opacity: 0, rotation: ROT_FROM },
  { scale: 1, opacity: 1, rotation: 0, duration: POP_DUR, ease: `back.out(${OVERSHOOT})` },
  GROUP_ENTRY_AT + i * STAGGER,
);
```

Even here keep `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2` — past that it reads as cartoon wobble. Better still: the baked spring at `dampingFraction: 0.6–0.7` (same adapters doc) gives ~5–10% overshoot that reads physical where `back.out` reads cartoon.

| POP_DUR    | 0.4–0.7s                                  | shorter = tight snap; hero must be visible by **t ≤ 0.5s**       |

| ITEM_COUNT | 3–9                                       | >9 makes the stagger vanish — switch to a wipe/sweep reveal      |
| Y_RISE     | 0–32px                                    | small; never large enough to read as a slide-up                  |
| ROT_FROM   | −10°–+10°                                 | playful variant only; alternate sign by index (`i % 2 ? 6 : -6`) |
| ENTRY_AT   | 0–0.4s                                    | a beat of quiet, but keep the subject landing by t ≤ 0.5s        |

## Critical Constraints

- Default ease `power3.out` (no overshoot); `back.out` only in the explicitly-playful variant, and there `OVERSHOOT ≤ ~2`.
- `ITEM_COUNT × STAGGER ≤ ~0.5s` — the group must land inside one beat.
- Entrances state the collapsed from-state in `fromTo` — never rely on a CSS-hidden start (it renders visible before the tween claims it under seek).
- `transform-origin: 50% 50%` for an in-place pop; the source point only for the anchored variation.
- This is a finite arrival — idle motion on a held element is a separate, later `sine-wave-loop` tween.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR  | 0.3–0.8s                                | fast snap vs deliberate pen trace; >~1s feels sluggish for a logo reveal                           |
| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
