## Frame 6 — Action and trace: TaskAgent

- scene: An Envelope message becomes a prioritized work-order list while a JSONL trace scrolls beside it.
- voiceover: "TaskAgent turns the report into a prioritized work order, saves photo evidence, and writes the hand-off to a JSONL trace."
- duration: 9.003s
- poster: 7s
- transition_in: crossfade
- status: outline
- src: compositions/frames/06-action-trace.html
- type: feature_showcase
- persuasion: Causal chain
- beat: Momentum and payoff
- blueprint: transcript-scroll-artifact-reveal (Adapt)
- focal: the JSONL hand-off becoming a work order
- roles: JSONL trace = foreground evidence surface · envelope rows = supporting midground · work-order card = payoff foreground

Adapt: keep the evidence traversal and artifact reveal; use the project’s Orchestrator → ScannerAgent → AnalystAgent → TaskAgent messages as the long surface.

Scene 1 (0.0–2.1s): a warm-navy trace surface establishes with one message row, then three more envelope lines cascade beneath it (`waterfall-entry`) in a full-width upper-83% strip.
Scene 2 (2.1–4.5s): the trace content scrolls upward through the frame (`3d-page-scroll` flat variant), revealing sender, recipient, message type, and confidence metadata in reading order.
Scene 3 (4.5–6.6s): the final TaskAgent hand-off receives a coral selection marker; a work-order card expands from the selected line (`anchored-layout-expand`) as the only hinge.
Scene 4 (6.6–9.0s): the work order holds beside the last trace line, with “photo evidence + machine-readable task” as the calm payoff.

narrativeRole: Complete the operational loop and prove that communication is defined, routed, and recorded.
keyMessage: The output is useful to staff and auditable to reviewers.

# 3D Page Scroll

A webpage (or long content) presented as a tilted 3D card. Spring-eased scroll reveals specific sections while the static 3D perspective adds physical depth. (For a camera that actually travels/tilts, see [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md) — this rule's tilt never moves.)

## How It Works

Two independent transforms combine:

1. **3D tilt** — static `rotateY` + `rotateX` with `perspective` on the card. The angle does **not** change during the scene.
2. **Scroll** — the content inside the card translates vertically (`y` in GSAP) within a clipped container; spring-like deceleration via `power3.out` / `power4.out`.

Optional: **spotlight overlay** — a radial-gradient mask dims everything except a focal region after the scroll lands. It sits above the scrolling content, fixed relative to the card, never inside `.page-content`.

## Recipe

```html
<div class="tilt-card">
  <div class="page-content">
    <!-- Full {Brand} webpage recreation, taller than the card so scrolling
         matters. Each section is REAL DOM, not a screenshot — screenshots
         can't be individually highlighted or scrolled-to with precision. -->
    <section class="page-hero">{heroContents}</section>
    <section class="page-features">{featuresContents}</section>
    <section class="page-target" id="target-section">{targetContents}</section>
    <section class="page-cta">{ctaContents}</section>
  </div>
  <div class="spotlight"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.tilt-card {
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  /* tilt + perspective in CSS only if no other transform tween touches this
     element — if GSAP also tweens scale on .tilt-card, set the tilt via
     gsap.set() instead to avoid matrix overwrites */
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%) perspective({perspectivePx}) rotateY({tiltYDeg}) rotateX({tiltXDeg});
  transform-style: preserve-3d;
  width: {cardWidth};
  height: {cardHeight};
  border-radius: 24px;
  background: {cardBackgroundColor};
  overflow: hidden; /* clip the scrolling content at the rounded corners */
  /* shadow X-offset sign must match tiltY sign (negative tiltY ⇒ positive X) */
  box-shadow: 40px 30px 80px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.45);
}
.page-content {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  /* height intrinsic from sections — taller than the card */
}
.spotlight {
  position: absolute;
  inset: 0;
  pointer-events: none;
  opacity: 0;
  background: radial-gradient(ellipse 60% 35% at 50% 50%, transparent 50%, {spotlightDimColor} 100%);
}
```

```js
// SCROLL_DISTANCE is measured at design time from the real page layout
// (top of .page-content origin to vertical center of #target-section,
// accounting for card height) — NOT a free tunable.
tl.to(
  ".page-content",
  { y: -SCROLL_DISTANCE, duration: SCROLL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  SCROLL_AT,
);

// Spotlight fades in on the target after the scroll settles.
tl.to(
  ".spotlight",
  { opacity: 1, duration: SPOTLIGHT_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.inOut" },
  SPOTLIGHT_AT,
);
```

## Variations

**Multi-step scroll (scroll → pause → scroll)** — multiple `y:` tweens at different positions. Distances are both measured from the `.page-content` origin (NOT delta from the previous step); GSAP composes successive `y:` tweens on the same property, each starting from the value the previous one left:

```js
tl.to(
  ".page-content",
  { y: -SCROLL_DISTANCE_A, duration: SCROLL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  SCROLL_AT_A,
);
tl.to(
  ".page-content",
  { y: -SCROLL_DISTANCE_B, duration: SCROLL_DUR, ease: "power3.out" },
  SCROLL_AT_B,
);
// SCROLL_AT_A + SCROLL_DUR ≤ SCROLL_AT_B — the two scrolls must not fight for y
```

## Critical Constraints

- **Tilt is static** — the card holds its angle the whole scene.
- **Shadow direction matches tilt** — a left-leaning card casts shadow to the right (positive X offset); mismatch breaks the 3D illusion.
- **Page content is real HTML, not a screenshot**; scroll distances come from the real layout geometry.
- **`overflow: hidden` + `transform-style: preserve-3d` on `.tilt-card`** — clip at the rounded corners; preserve-3d for any 3D children / clean perspective composition.
- **Spotlight is an overlay above the scrolling content**, never inside `.page-content`.
- **Same easing across a multi-phase scroll**, and non-overlapping scroll windows.

# Anchored Layout Expand

> The law: **author the layout at its final (expanded) state in CSS, then fake the collapsed state with transforms.** The container never changes size — the _visible_ region does — and everything downstream rides a matched translate. The browser computes layout ONCE; every intermediate frame is pure transform.

THE one-axis growth primitive: a container pinned at one edge appears to grow along a single axis, and the in-flow content after it moves in perfect contact with the traveling edge — dropdown, sub-task stack, growing composer card, pane widening over a neighbor. Growth and push are ONE motion: if the panel's bottom edge and the pushed content ever separate or overlap, the illusion dies.

Distinct from [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (a free-floating two-shot morph with no neighbors to push — this rule's container is a live layout participant), [spring-pop-entrance.md](spring-pop-entrance.md) (arrival at a point, no edge travel or reflow), and [reactive-displacement.md](reactive-displacement.md) (displacement by a colliding intruder; here content moves because the container's edge reached it — layout causality, not collision).

## How It Works

1. **Mask** — a wrapper at the final body height (`BODY_H`), `overflow: hidden`. Never tweened.
2. **Sheet** — the panel surface + content inside the mask, starting at `y: -BODY_H` (tucked above the mask window, behind the pinned header).
3. **Below** — ONE wrapper holding everything after the container, also starting at `y: -BODY_H`.
4. **Grow** — ONE `fromTo` drives sheet AND below from `y: -BODY_H → 0`. Shared tween ⇒ the descending bottom edge and the pushed content stay in exact contact by construction. Collapse = the same pair tweened back.

When the surface must visibly **stretch in place** (rows revealed top-first, or a pane growing sideways), use the proxy counter-scale variant below instead.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="stack">
  <div class="expander">
    <div class="expander-head">{headerLabel}</div>
    <div class="expand-mask" id="expand-mask" data-layout-allow-overflow>
      <div class="expand-sheet" id="expand-sheet">
        <div class="expand-row">{rowA}</div>
        <div class="expand-row">{rowB}</div>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <!-- EVERYTHING that must be pushed lives in this one wrapper -->
  <div class="below" id="below">{followingContent}</div>
</div>
```

```css
/* Layout is the EXPANDED end state — no collapsed geometry exists in CSS. */
.expander-head {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 2; /* the sheet slides out from UNDER the header */
}
.expand-mask {
  height: BODY_H; /* authored final height — NEVER tweened */
  overflow: hidden;
}
.expand-sheet {
  height: BODY_H;
  border-radius: 0 0 SHEET_RADIUS SHEET_RADIUS; /* bottom-only — header + sheet read as one grown card */
  will-change: transform; /* + on .below */
}
```

```js
// BODY_H must equal the mask's CSS height exactly — measure once at build.
// (Montage caveat: per the contract, in a multi-scene master use an authored
// CSS-matched constant instead — later clips may not be laid out yet.)
const BODY_H = document.querySelector("#expand-mask").offsetHeight;

// The grow: ONE tween, BOTH sides of the seam.
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: -BODY_H },
  { y: 0, duration: GROW_DUR, ease: GROW_EASE },
  GROW_AT,
);

// Garnish: rows already ride the sheet; the fade stagger makes them read as "options arriving".
tl.fromTo(
  ".expand-row",
  { opacity: 0 },
  { opacity: 1, duration: ROW_FADE_DUR, stagger: ROW_STAGGER, ease: "power2.out" },
  GROW_AT + GROW_DUR * 0.25,
);

// Collapse — same machinery back; faster (closing is a snap decision).
tl.fromTo(
  ["#expand-sheet", "#below"],
  { y: 0 },
  { y: -BODY_H, duration: COLLAPSE_DUR, ease: "power3.in", immediateRender: false },
  COLLAPSE_AT,
);
```

## Variations

- **Proxy counter-scale — surface stretches in place** (rows revealed top-first holding their screen positions; the "payload card expands from the tool-call line"). Drive mask `scaleY` and the sheet's exact inverse from ONE proxy — two independent tweens are wrong: eased midpoints of `s` and `1/s` are not inverses and the content squashes mid-grow. Net content scale is `s × 1/s = 1` every frame; seek-safe because everything derives from the one interpolated proxy.

  ```js
  const grow = { h: COLLAPSED_H }; // 0 for fully collapsed
  tl.fromTo(
    grow,
    { h: COLLAPSED_H },
    {
      h: BODY_H,
      duration: GROW_DUR,
      ease: GROW_EASE,
      onUpdate: () => {
        const s = Math.max(grow.h / BODY_H, 0.0001); // clamp: no divide-by-zero
        gsap.set("#expand-mask", { scaleY: s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#expand-sheet", { scaleY: 1 / s, transformOrigin: "50% 0%" });
        gsap.set("#below", { y: grow.h - BODY_H });
      },
    },
    GROW_AT,
  );
  ```

- **One-axis pane expand (X)**: same machinery rotated 90° — pin the left edge, sheet from `x: -PANE_W` (or proxy `scaleX` + counter-scale, origin `0% 50%`). Decide the neighbor's fate explicitly: **overlap** (pane paints over it, no neighbor tween) or **push** (neighbor rides the same tween). Never both.
- **Typed-wrap growth** — the composer card gets taller as typed text wraps. Quantize: one short step per wrap boundary, each moving the pair by one `LINE_H`; wrap times come from the deterministic typing schedule ([discrete-text-sequence.md](discrete-text-sequence.md)), never measured at render time. Two battle-tested traps:
  - **Composer cards have no pinned header** — a composer grows from its TOP edge (the send-button footer stays put), so a plain y-step clips the card's top out of the mask. Combine the proxy counter-scale with the wrap quantization (step the proxy by `LINE_H` at each wrap time) and split the surface into a **sheet** (carries the top radius) + **footer** (carries the bottom radius) so the growth seam stays invisible.
  - **Wrap TIME vs wrap POSITION are two different authorities** — the typing schedule decides _when_ a wrap fires, the browser's line-breaking decides _where_ text actually wraps, and with proportional fonts they silently disagree. Author an explicit `\n` in the typed string (with `white-space: pre-wrap`) at the chosen split point so both derive from the same authored fact.
- **Springy open** (rare, explicitly-playful): `back.out(1.2)` — the edge overshoots a few px; the pushed content bounces with the panel (correct — they're in contact). Default stays `power3.out`.
- **Row grows a sub-task stack**: the row is the pinned header, the stack is the sheet, every later row lives in `#below`; chain several scopes for progressive disclosure.
- **FLIP hand-off**: if the container also TRAVELS to a new layout slot while resizing (prompt promoted to heading, card docking into a sidebar), that's a FLIP problem — `/hyperframes-keyframes` (FLIP recipes). This rule stays the in-place one-axis specialist.

## Critical Constraints

- **NEVER tween `width` / `height` / `top` / `left` / `margin` / `padding`** — the mask's height is a CSS constant; only its children transform. Tweening the mask IS the forbidden move this rule replaces.
- **`data-layout-allow-overflow` on the mask** — the collapsed phase parks the sheet outside the mask's box by construction, which trips the `hyperframes check` layout gate (`container_overflow`). The flag is the sanctioned waiver: this overflow is the technique working as designed, not a bug.
- **Sheet + below share one tween (or one proxy)** — matched-but-separate tweens on the two sides of the contact edge are the classic seam bug.
- **Everything downstream rides `#below`** — content outside the wrapper is overlapped at t=0 and orphaned during the grow.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the mask** — without it the tucked sheet is visible above the header at t=0.
- **Counter-scale needs a proxy**, clamped `s ≥ 0.0001` (a fully-collapsed body divides by zero).
- **Deterministic sizes** — `BODY_H`, `LINE_H`, `WRAP_TIMES` are build-time constants or one-time measurements, never per-frame layout reads.

# Waterfall Entry

Staggered ARRIVAL cascade: words/elements whip in from below (one consistent direction),
each starting before the previous settles — an accelerating wave that resolves into a
composed layout. Title cards, segment openers, list/feature intros.

**This is an in-scene arrival, not a seam.** Its seam sibling is the waterfall CUT
(`cut-the-curve` doctrine skill, `seams/waterfall-cut.md`); do not mix their rules:

|               | Entry (this rule — arrival)                   | Waterfall Cut (seam)                                      |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| Opacity       | BINARY 0→1 via `tl.set` at entry — never fade | ignites at 0.35 mid-path — the fade IS the velocity trick |
| Axis default  | Y, from below                                 | X, riding the current                                     |
| Outgoing side | none                                          | words ramp out on mirrored power4.in                      |

## Choreography

- **Overlap, don't queue** — next element starts within ±2 frames of the previous
  settling; gaps SHRINK across the cascade; the last element snaps.
- **Velocity varies by weight** — heavy/anchor elements travel further and longer;
  light words/punctuation snap in tight:

| Parameter | Anchor/heavy | Normal word | Light/punctuation |
| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Y offset  | 60–80px      | 40–50px     | 30–48px           |
| Duration  | 0.16–0.20s   | 0.13–0.16s  | 0.10–0.13s        |
| Overlap   | 0–2f gap     | 1f overlap  | 1–2f overlap      |

- Ease `power4.out` (`expo.out` for extra snap); never `.inOut` on an entry.
- One direction per cascade.
- Split the FINAL word into fragments to extend the climax; fragments travel further.
- Post-settle, the group usually slides to make room for the next beat — that's
  [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md).

## JS

Each element: `tl.set` (instant reveal + offset) then `tl.to` (whip to rest).
`nextStart = prevStart + prevDuration − (overlapFrames × F)`; +overlap = cascade,
−overlap = deliberate gap. CSS: elements start `opacity: 0; display: inline-block`.

```js
var F = 1 / 60;
var t0 = 0.1;
// anchor (heaviest): biggest travel, longest settle
tl.set("#el-1", { opacity: 1, y: 80 }, t0);
tl.to("#el-1", { y: 0, duration: 0.18, ease: "power4.out" }, t0);
// normal word: 2 frames after the anchor finishes
var t1 = t0 + 0.18 + 2 * F;

## Anti-patterns

| Don't                                                  | Instead                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Queued entries (each waits for the previous to settle) | Overlap ±1–2 frames — the cascade is a wave, not a queue                          |
| Same offset/duration for every cascade element         | Vary by weight: anchors travel further, punctuation snaps                         |
| Gradual opacity fade on an arrival                     | Binary 0→1 via `tl.set` — fading fights the snap (seam cuts fade; arrivals don't) |
